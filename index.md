# The Digital Backlog Digest

Why did I start Digital Backlog? It is simple, I had a large back log of games that I wanted to play and I kept on rotating between them. Eventually forgetting where I left off. I decided that I should just play through one game at a time. But soon enough I would buy another new shiny game and play that instead. Forgetting where I left off in the previous game. I felt like I could be more productive in doing this and saw someone uploading playthroughs online when Let's plays were becoming a thing. I thought about it for some time and decided to start doing that. I brought a usb microphone and an Elegato capture card from Best Buy. I spent the next little while learning how to record commentary all the while playing games. I honed my skills for about two years while building up the courage to actually upload anything. After getting my SNES Classic, I decided that I wanted to do my first play through on The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past
